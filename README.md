## General Information
- access to graphql API by URL:  http://localhost:4000
- There should be a list with three categories (All, Tech, Clothes). All category comes from the API as well.
- PLP - product listing page, a.k.a. category page
- PDP - product description page, a.k.a. product page
- Cart page + Cart overlay (minicart)
- Tasks should match the design from Figma
<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->


## Technologies Used
- React (class components)
- GraphQL
- Redux Toolkit
- CSS-in-JS (styled-components)
- Figma


## Features
- Ability to add/remove products and change their amounts in cart - on the cart page itself, PLP and PDP should be provided.
- For products that have various options (attributes) - the options should be selected.
- The selected options of added to cart products should be visible in cart overlay and in cart page.
- If an attribute is a swatch attribute (type = swatch), a representation of the value should be rendered on PDP and PLP, rather than text description (e.g. the color itself, not "Blue" or "0000FF")
- Filtering products by category name for all of the categories from BE
- The descriptions provided in HTML format should be parsed and presented as HTML, not as plain text
- Ability to change the currency of the store to one of the available currencies

## Setup

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
